OpenGL 2D Default

**Purpose:** To be a simple, bare-bones starting point for 2D OpenGL applications using GLUT. All my 2D OpenGL applications have to set up orthogonal projection, almost all have to register callback functions, and keyboard and mouse tracking variables are nice, too. So I decided I'd save myself some time and make a template so I don't have to set all this up every time I want to make a quick little prototype.
